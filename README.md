# Learn Terraform


## Why?

We need a consistent, self-documenting 
and version-controllable way of managing our infrastructure.
So that _anyone_ in our team or community can see _exactly_ 
how everything is setup and we can evolve/improve our system
without fear of "breaking" things in Production!

Setting up "Cloud" infrastructure for basic Apps
using the Web UI is fine the first couple of times,
in fact we _encourage_ people to use the UI 
in order to learn how everythign works.
Once you have a mission critical Application that many people rely on,
setting things up _manually_ by clicking UI is not sustainable.


## What?

Terraform enables you to safely and predictably 
create, change, and improve infrastructure. 
It is an open source tool that codifies APIs 
into declarative configuration files 
that can be shared amongst team members, 
treated as code, edited, reviewed, and versioned.

Terraform is an example of
[infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)

In this guide we are going to setup a 
Phoenix Web Application running on AWS.
